#Reflection on Week4 Content
Week 4 is the most challenging week of this course. Unlike the preceding assignments that I can write an algorithm in a short single script, I need to sub-divide the assignment problems into different small pieces.
For example, I need to write class modules to represent graphs and vertices. Also, I have to figure out how to make my selection of edge uniformly random. After classes of vertices and graphs are constructed, I have 
to implement the edge contraction and its concrete steps are hardly outlined in the lecture as the lecture only offers me a high-level overview of the idea. It spends me much time to figure out how to contract an edge
of a graph. 

Though the assignment 4 is done, the work is not complete yet because algorithm is still inefficient (more than 2.5 hours to complete 200**2 runs).
My next target is to optimise the outstanding algorithm and make it run faster and more memory efficient.
